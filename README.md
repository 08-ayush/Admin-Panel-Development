## Starter Crm App based on mern stack (Express.js / MongoDb / React / Redux / AntD) with generic crud and auth , admin management .





This is a full-stack JavaScript application that allows users user registration with first name, last name, email, and password, allowing users to log in and log out.
An admin panel should enable admins to create, view, update, and delete users. Passwords must be securely hashed, and role-based access control (RBAC) should restrict admin panel access to admins. 
Form validation is required on both frontend and backend, with pagination and search functionality in the admin panel. Proper error handling should ensure user-friendly messages.
